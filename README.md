# Files
Template.py is the base template we will be using in the competition, so make a copy and don't edit the original if you are working on something. Copytemplate.py will duplicate template.py so we can quickly make copies during the competition.

# Topics
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_r5eKWFf-iQt5iTq9Okb8-MWNqSVJwPguNzSZzQlcCw/edit?usp=sharing) is a list of topics that you should be familiar with. If you think something should be added, you're free to make changes.
The list also has some important algorithms that we might want to print out solutions to towards the bottom.

# Strategy
General: Brute force solutions are okay as long as they complete in under 2 minutes (the missing terms short question is a good example of this). We can also get partial points, so a solution that only works some of the time is better than no solution.

Short problems: We get 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete as many as possible. The questions range from 5-45 points, but their difficulty doesn't always match the points you get for them so pick the ones that look the nicest. The winning team from last year got 80 points on short questions, which should be a good goal for us. That would make each 15 point question worth about 20 minutes of full time from the team, but we will be splitting up work so more time is okay. I think it might also be smart to stay away from the problems worth 30 and above unless we are sure we can get them/we have lots of time.

Long problems: Our goal is to solve 2 of these, but even 1 is still great and can be enough to win. The first few minutes need to be spent finding the easiest (and maybe second easiest) problem, so we should divide and conquer (everyone reads one or two questions. maybe be able to rate it 1-5 on how hard it will be so we can quickly decide). We should all work on the same problem together and try to finish it in 30 minutes or less so we can do the second one. If we donâ€™t have enough time to solve the second one completely, we should aim for at least partial points.
