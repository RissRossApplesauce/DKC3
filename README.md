# Files
Template.py is the base template we will be using in the competition, so make a copy and don't edit the original if you are working on something. Copytemplate.py will duplicate template.py so we can quickly make copies during the competition.

# Topics
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_r5eKWFf-iQt5iTq9Okb8-MWNqSVJwPguNzSZzQlcCw/edit?usp=sharing) is a list of topics that you should be familiar with. If you think something should be added, you're free to make changes.
The list also has some important algorithms that we might want to print out solutions to towards the bottom.

# Strategy
Short problems: as a team, we want to get about 3 points/min to get 100%, so a 30 point problem is worth about 10 minutes of full attention from the team. Obviously we will be splitting up work, so if you spend a half hour on a 30 point problem working alone, its probably still worth the effort (as long as we actually solve it. If it’s way too difficult, drop it for later if we have time or work with someone else).
There are usually about 5 problems that go above 25 points, and problems are worth 20 points on average. There are sometimes problems that are more difficult than they are worth, just look out for them and skip them if you have to.

Long problems: our goal is to solve 2 of these, but 1 is still great. The first few minutes need to be spent finding the easiest (and second easiest) problem, so we should divide and conquer (everyone reads one or two questions. maybe be able to rate it 1-5 on how hard it will be so we can quickly decide). We should all work on the same problem together and try to finish it in 30 minutes or less so we can do the second one. If we don’t have enough time to solve the second one completely, it might still be possible to get partial points by solving it for only some of the cases.
