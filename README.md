# DKC3 2022 Practice Files
This repo contains most of the practice we did to win the 2022 competition.

## Rules and Recent Practice Problems

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DigiKey is now using [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) for submitting and grading solutions. The PDFs and solutions here are still relevant, but the templates were made specifically for the old competition format and will be outdated.

## Files:
* Year folders
    * Long Programming - Input/Output files for Long Problems.
    * Short Programming - Input/Output files for Short Problems.
    * PDFs - Problems from that year's competition. Some are missing.
    * Solutions (*.py) - Some of these were made for a different folder structure and won't run without tweaks. No guarantee they're correct either.
* Templates - Templates we used during the competition to avoid unecessary typing.
* Notes - Just some quick notes on the python language we wanted to have with us in case we forgot.

We went through and put in explanations for most of the solutions in 2016 if you're curious.

## Templates
Make a template like the one we used that you can then make copies of. This saves a lot of time typing during the competition. Make sure your template has error handling! Not handling errors could easily cut your score in half or worse. Know your template well enough to fix it if they change the competition a little!

We also made a file called copytemplate.py to make using our template easy: it duplicates the template file, renames it to match each problem, and sets the file names in the template to match.

## Strategy
**Bring solutions for past years' questions.** They tend to reuse 1 or 2 every year (15-30 free points!).

**PRINT OFF EVERYTHING YOU WILL NEED.** Especially your template.

I recommend VSCode if you plan on doing Python. Note that you will not have internet access during the competition. If you use VSCode, it will come loaded with just the bare minimum plugins to run Python.

#### Dividing up work:

Try to split up work. If everyone is stumped on the same problem you're wasting time.

#### Short problems:

A good rule of thumb is that 1 point is worth about 1 minute. If you're split up, each person should aim to get .25 points per minute. Keep in mind that each year the point value of questions can vary.
Also, be careful with 30 or more point problems, they are high risk but not always high reward.

#### Word problems:

This is ironically where we got most of our points in the 2022 coding competition. Have everyone work separately at the start. If you can't solve one, move on to the next. Pass questions around so everyone gets a chance to look at them. Don't leave answers blank; guess if you're running out of time.

#### Long problems:

Pick the easiest one first and solve it. Then the next easiest. If you solve 1 you're doing great, solve 2 and you are likely to win. Look out for trick questions, some of them look easy but have crazy runtimes that will never complete in the 2 minutes. Split up if one of the questions is really easy.

If you run out of problems you know how to solve, or you don't have enough time to do another full problem, try to come up with a cheap solution for it instead.

#### Cheap Solutions:

Don't be afraid to cut corners if you can't solve something. When we ran into questions like "Print the name of the highest scoring team" and got stumped with the rules, we just randomly printed out a team name and hoped to get lucky. This strategy got us 15 points in the 2022 competition and we only won by 7.5 points. The key is getting your chance of earning points above 0%.
